## PlayFlow & Insturctions

1. Pressing *"Play"* gives access to the list of Football Teams running for the current World Cup Title. The Teams are divided in pots, based on teams strength (as it is in reality).
2. *"Draw teams"* creates mixed groups making sure each one has 1 Team from every Pot.
3. From now on, the game will continue into the *"Schedule"* page. Each team will play against each other team of the group once. In between matches it's possible to check the "real time *Tables* from the respective page.
4. After all the 3 matches the groups are done. The first 2 teams earned their access to the knock-out stage, playable from the *"Charts"* page.
5. Play the final matches to find out who will be the ***Football World Cup Winner!***
